# Kyber

**Kyber** is an AI-powered digital curator orchestration framework designed for intelligent museum exhibition planning. It is a core component of the **MUSAD** project (*Museo dell’Università Suor Orsola Benincasa per un’Accessibilità in Digitale*).

Built on the open-source `llama-cpp-agent`, Kyber acts as the "brain" of the KYBER ecosystem, bridging the gap between digital archives (**DROSOS**) and virtual exhibition spaces (**MNEMOS**). It automates RAG-based (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) artwork discovery and narrative creation to empower curators in the digital age.

##  Key Capabilities

* **Multimodal Discovery:** Generate exhibition concepts using natural language, reference images, or hybrid search across DROSOS and external databases.
* **Intelligent Retrieval:** Automated filtering of artworks by theme, technique, historical period, and author, discovering connections that traditional keyword searches might miss.
* **Curatorial Logic:** AI-driven generation of coherent museum paths, including narrative descriptions, thematic links, and display suggestions.
* **Open Source & Sustainable:** Fully transparent and customizable architecture ensuring long-term sustainability for cultural institutions.

2.  **KYBER (This Repo):** AI Orchestration engine for curatorial support.
3.  **MNEMOS (by Glossa Srl):** Virtual exhibition environment for 3D/digital visualization.
